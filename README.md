# linear-system-solver
C++ code for solving system of linear equations. In particular I focused in Gaussâ€“Seidel, Jacobi (iterative methods) and Gauss Elimination (direct method). Results had shown that the efficiency of the results depends to the algorithm and the dimension of the system. To achieve high accuracy is important to consider the error functions of approximation and truncation made by the machine.
